# fake_news_detection_twitter
- SVM Algorithm implmented from scratch to detect fake news in social media (Twitter)
- KNN, Naive Bayes, Neural Network, Decision Tree algorithms are used from the inbuilt R package for Comparison of accuracy with our implementation.


# Packages That has be installed:
- caret
- neuralnet
- rattle
- rpart.plot
- rpart
- RColorBrewer
- rgl
- stringr
- stringi
- scatterplot3d

```sh
setwd('Please set the src directory as Working directory')
excute DM.R
```

# Key Points:
- Time Complexity of SVM
     (stepCnt)(bCnt)(2^d)*(n)
     where d is the number of features
